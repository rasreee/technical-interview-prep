# technical-interview-prep
Data structures & algorithms implementations and coding problem solutions. Written in Typescript and tested with Jest. Coding problems are pulled from LeetCode and Daily Coding Problem.

This is how I review data structures & algorithms and practice for coding interviews. My goal for this repo to track my progress and to share my attempts at data structures/algorithms/coding problems for Typescript.
